The increasing popularity of online shopping necessitates the development of
reliable and efficient online shopping cart systems.This work uses C++ programming to create and implement an online shopping
cart, which is modular and expandable due to object-oriented principles.The system uses data structures like linked lists to store and retrieve product
information efficiently, and includes searching algorithms for a scalable and
responsive shopping experience.Portability was a priority, and the program is compatible with a wide range of
operating systems. High performance is guaranteed by C++.

This project is a basic implementation of a shopping cart system using C++ programming language. The
program allows users to perform various actions, such as adding items to the cart,
removing items, searching for items, and displaying the contents of the cart.
